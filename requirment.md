Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithm that finds the shortest path between a source node and all other nodes in a graph. The algorithm uses the weights of the edges to find the path that minimizes the total distance between the source node and all other nodes. 

Dijkstra's algorithm is based on the Greedy Algorithm principle. It can be used to solve many single-source shortest path problems with non-negative edge weight in graphs. For example, it can be used to find the shortest path between your current location and a destination on a Google map. 

Dijkstra's algorithm was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later. It can be implemented in different programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Python.
